out how to check that the forml is valid.  this may involve adding a validation construct to the forml spec, so that this is easy to change.. \r\n\r\nfor example, we need to be able to check that \r\n\r\n* elements don't have invalid display types selected (dependent on element type)\r\n\r\n* subscribe controls are subscribed to a channel that actually exists\r\n\r\n* etc.. \r\n\r\nInitially make a class called ViewValidator and fill it with stubbed out methods for each of the checks. Then make each of these methods a new JIRA ticket.\r\n\r\n\r\n*UPDATE*\r\nHere are the checks that were decided on (the first portion will be done here in the viewValidator, the second portion, as indicated, will be validated by QA):\r\n\r\n1.\tFor a multipage form each page needs at least one element on it (or the iPad breaks.).\r\n2.\tIn Fields:\r\n      a.   In the Element tab:\r\n         i.      A Type should be selected\r\n                 - (check all available elements are correct for the selected type)\r\n         ii.      Label will always be set to “required” so ensure it’s present. Validation required.\r\n         iii.      If a default is set:\r\n            1.         If it is set to “value” ensure a value has been entered that fits with whatever the FormL spec says is allowed. It can be any string. Maybe specify a character limit.\r\n            2.         If it is set to “macro” ensure a macro has been applied, currently either “midnightOfArrival” or “today”.\r\n         iv.      If Memory Text is enabled, ensure it has a (memory text) buffer set – it becomes invalid if empty.\r\n         v.      If there’s a Dictionary check any selected references exist.\r\n         vi.      In Controls:\r\n            1.         If “publish” is selected ensure it has a publish channel specified\r\n            2.         If “subscribe” is selected\r\n               a.            Ensure it has a channel specified\r\n               b.            Ensure any selected control attributes are applied.\r\n            3.         If “minValue” or “maxValue” are selected, ensure an element is selected\r\n            4.         If “constraints” is selected:\r\n               a.           Ensure at least one option is specified\r\n               b.           If Data Definition is checked: This option is hidden until it needs to be implemented in the future (see ticket FFBM-508).)\r\n      b.   In the Advanced tab:\r\n         i.      Ensure the Element ID exists and is unique. \r\n         ii.      Font Size – if one is specified ensure it’s applied correctly. The range should be 7 to 14pt, but ideally it should always be 12.\r\n         iii.      Size/Position: ensure both arrays have values\r\n3.\tIn Groups/Group:\r\n      a.   Ensure the Group ID exists and is unique\r\n      b.   Ensure that any fields in the group actually exist.\r\n      c.   If any Attributes are selected, ensure that the multiValue display type is selected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor QA:\r\n1.\tIn Fields:\r\n   a.\t   In the Element tab:\r\n      i.\t      Check all applied Attributes are working.\r\n      ii.      In Controls:\r\n1.\t         If a Display Type is selected ensure it is applied correctly (Textbox, Spliced, Height, Checkbox, Radio, Picklist)\r\n      iii.\t      If any Display Attributes are selected ensure they work in the form. (Keyboard, Autocorrect, NumberShift, Time, Date, Numeric)\r\n\r\n   b.\t   In the Advanced tab:\r\n      i.\t      Size/Position\r\n         1.

want to gather information on the screen orientation our users have the iPad in when using our app.\r\n\r\nApparently we already log when users switch to a different page or tab, we could also log the current screen orientation at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt might also be nice to know when users just change orientation without changing pages/tabs; \r\n* But that would depend on how difficult that would be to implement AND\r\n* If doing that would provide useful information that we are not getting from checking the orientation at page/tab changes.\r\n\r\n----\r\nh6. Testing\r\n\r\nThe change has simply been to put logging into the application to record certain orientation events, and to modify one existing log event to include either (P) or (L) to indicate whether the current orientation is Portrait or Landscape.\r\n\r\n{{switch to CaptureGrid for encounter_TA<...>52A0 (P)}}\r\n{{User Interface Orientation change to Portrait<Portrait>}}\r\n{{D UI:AppDelegate.m switch to TemplateManager (P)}}\r\n{{D UI:AppDelegate.m switch to EncounterViewController (P)}}\r\n\r\nI've trimmed these messages so they fit without wrapping, but hopefully this is enough for you to search the log file for examples. The messages are issued:\r\n\r\n# Existing message (such as switching between tabs) now appends {{(P)}} or {{(L)}} to indicate Portrait or Landscape.\r\n# Message issued by the AppDelegate whenever the orientation of the device changes. Note that it has two parts: either {{Portrait}} or {{Landscape}} and then further detail inside the <> to tell you whether it is portrait right side up or upside down, or landscape left or right. (I added it the way I did to make searching the log easier).\r\n# Switching between Template Manager and EncounterViewController is also logged.\r\n\r\nThere are probably messages I've missed, but it's easy enough to add more if requested.\r\n","customfield_10001":"2014-07-10 08:49:13.386","customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"issuelinks":[],"customfield_10004":1.0,"customfield_10000":"3_*:*_1_*:*_240080_*|*_10015_*:*_1_*:*_34904479_*|*_1_*:*_2_*:*_4159000367_*|*_6_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_5_*:*_1_*:*_11757370_*|*_10030_*:*_1_*:*_36413207","subtasks":[],"customfield_10008":null,"customfield_10007":["com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint@10c3418[rapidViewId=7,state=CLOSED,name=Sprint 40,startDate=2014-07-02T09:24:00.000-05:00,endDate=2014-07-16T09:24:00.000-05:00,completeDate=2014-07-16T08:42:15.670-05:00,id=187]"],"status":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

has purchased an Enterprise Developer License which will allow us to resign apps and distribute them in-house through MDM (we use AirWatch).  The process of resigning requires a new signature.  The signature must come from our Enterprise Apple account.  In order to have that (it is a mobileprovision file), we must have a unique bundle id.  Since com.shareableink.Shareable-Ink is already in use, it cannot be added into our Enterprise Account.  Initially we will have to get a build with a different bundle id.  Then I can generate a new mobileprovision file.  Then I believe I can (untested since we haven't had a new mobileprovision file) resign the app in AirWatch and successfully deploy.\r\n\r\nPlease keep me (Pete Dunlap) in the loop, as I'd like to document as much as possible of the work completed on this ticket.","customfield_10001":"2014-07-08 16:01:14.587","customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"issuelinks":[],"customfield_10004":5.0,"customfield_10000":"3_*:*_1_*:*_457528102_*|*_1_*:*_1_*:*_1195566543_*|*_6_*:*_1_*:*_0","subtasks":[],"customfield_10008":null,"customfield_10007":["com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint@10c3418[rapidViewId=7,state=CLOSED,name=Sprint 40,startDate=2014-07-02T09:24:00.000-05:00,endDate=2014-07-16T09:24:00.000-05:00,completeDate=2014-07-16T08:42:15.670-05:00,id=187]"],"status":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

term, our strategy for AirWatch is to manage clients' ipads through MDM (Airwatch is our current solution).  To do this on iOS, each client will have an Enterprise Apple account.  We will manage this for them and create a mobileprofile file for the application.  (This process is described in Ipad-1431).  Unfortunately this means each client will have to have a differently named app so that each client can have their own mobileprofile and AirWatch console environment.  The process of creating builds with seperate names per client will need to be automated.\r\n\r\nPlease keep me (Pete Dunlap) in the loop, as I'd like to document as much as possible of the work

an Anesthesia Cloud for iPad user, I need the ability to send SMS messages to my mobile phone from the iPad app. \r\n\r\n*Design:*\r\nAdd a new field to the User Management \"Edit User\" dialog to enter in a telephone number. (See attached Mockup)\r\n\r\n1) The field should have the following text:\r\n* SMS Paging Number\r\n\r\n2) The SMS phone number field should only accept the following inputs:\r\n* Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\r\n* Open and close parenthesis: ( )\r\n* Period: .\r\n* Dash: -\r\n\r\n2a)\r\n\r\n* For the tablet to send an SMS through the Twilio service, a ten digit phone number is required. Currently we are sending numbers like \"+16171234567\" through the service.\r\n* While we intend to continue to use Twilio, I suspect to send to a US cell phone, ten digits would be required for any service. So I think the requirements for other digit counts below are probably moot.\r\n* See http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/sending-messages if you are interested.\r\n* Given all that, whatever formats we accept, it would be most convenient for tablet if just the raw ten digits were stored.\r\n\r\n 3) The SMS phone number field should only accept inputs in the following formats (where \"n\" represents any number listed above):\r\n* <BLANK> (no entry at all or /null)\r\n* nnn-nnnn *Not available with the Twillow service - No longer a requirement*\r\n* (nnn) nnn-nnnn\r\n* nnn.nnn.nnnn\r\n* nnn-nnn-nnnn\r\n* nnn nnn nnnn\r\n* nnnnnnnnnn\r\n\r\n4) If the user attempts to leave the SMS phone number field after entering inputs do not meet criteria (1) and or (2) listed above, an \"OK\" popup should appear giving the following message:\r\n* Please enter a valid telephone number in one of the following formats:\r\n* nnn-nnnn *Not available with the Twillow service - No longer a requirement*\r\n* nnn-nnn-nnnn\r\n* (nnn) nnn-nnnn\r\n* nnn.nnn.nnnn\r\n\r\n\r\n*Acceptance Criteria*\r\nThe dashboard must:\r\n* Allow users to enter an SMS-enabled phone number (optional field)\r\n* Display a warning message if an invalid input in entered in the SMS phone number field.\r\n* Store that number in a way that will allow the Anesthesia Cloud for iPad app to access and use that number in the SMS Paging feature, and that number is associated with the user's first and last name. (This is now \"cellPhoneNumber\" on CouchUser; should be stored as a string with exactly ten digits and no formatting characters.)","customfield_10001":"2014-06-13 01:02:41.285","customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"18074","self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issueLink/18074","type":{"id":"10003","name":"Relates","inward":"relates to","outward":"relates to","self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10003"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"16414","key":"IPAD-715","self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/16414","fields":{"summary":"SMS Texts / Page sent from iPad App","status":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

I had an incorrect number in for my phone (I never call _myself_...) so that was the reason I didn't get the call. \r\nWhen I thought it was not accepting my changes this was because no matter what format the valid number is entered in as, it will always be displayed as the standard (XXX) XXX-XXXX. I entered in XXX.XXX.XXXX and when I went back in it had the standard format and thought it rejected my change, putting this into the release notes to avoid the same confusion by customers.\r\nFinally the blank white screen and deactivated account never repeated itself.
