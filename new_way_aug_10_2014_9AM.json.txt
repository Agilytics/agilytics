procedure codes in the records, I would like to be able to key in partial strings and choose the values from a pick list. \n*Acceptance Criteria*: \n* Pick list appears as user activates the touch area of the fields with dictionary fields enabled. \n* List gets filtered down as the user continues to type and match reduces. \n* items include short description and code \n* items sorted in alphabetical order \n* After the user picks the desired value from the pick list, it will be used to populate the field.\n* The dictionary function should be available in both online and offline mode. \n* Need to store the code itself for outbound interface and Insights. (see IPAD-1489)\n* Need to build it in a way that allows us to swap the dictionaries easily.  \n* Feature must allow entry of multiple codes for diagnosis, multiple codes for procedure.\n* QUESTION: How to handle modifiers when you have more than 1 code? \n\n*Questions for UI and design*\n* Do we want to show the short description or long description?\n** From Design Session: Short Description.\n* Do we want to show the short description, but expand the matching criteria to the long description: if what they type matches the long description, the short will show with the code. \n** Yes.\n* What's the size of the modal? \n** Eric is going to decide. \n* How to update the dictionaries?\n** Need to recompile. \n\n*Design Notes*\n* Separate modal for input, instead of typing directly on field. \n** Allow free text if no match. \n* Ocean to upload ICD-10 dictionary since it's the biggest. \n** ICD-10 Dictionary added \"ICD-10-2015.txt.zip\"\n* Multiple Diagnosis? \n* Still need to decide where to put it. \n* If all the iPads wants the update at the same time, can the server handle it? \n\n*Grooming Notes*\n* How to handle misspelling? \n\n\n*Notes from Customer Feedback*\nFrom a conversation with Millie Langan at HCA:\n* Important to be able to look up by procedure code or by string in short and long description\n* Important to be able to put multiple procedures, multiple diagnoses\n* When a code includes more than one procedure, unsure about whether we need to check procedure/diagnosis match on diagnoses beyond the original/primary – check with billing expert.\n* Rare that diagnosis and procedure don’t match, but it will sometimes happen – don’t rule it out!\n* Need to be able to specify Left or Right, Anterior, Posterior (ask anesthesiologists for the way to document). OK to put in a separate field in form.\n\n*Technical*\n\nFrom requirements so far, I think we can have a single dispatcher handler for codes. The dataFormat can be \"ICD9\" or \"ICD10\" or \"CPT\" or whatever, which will actually just be mapped to a specific reference table; there won't be anything specific to a particular dictionary to worry about yet.\n\nBut I don't really know how modifiers work yet, so that may change.\n","priority":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/priority/3","iconUrl":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.png","name":"Major","id":"3"},"customfield_10001":"2014-07-17 10:34:41.596","customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10004":0.0,"issuelinks":[{"id":"19848","self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issueLink/19848","type":{"id":"10003","name":"Relates","inward":"relates to","outward":"relates to","self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10003"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"25823","key":"IPAD-1492","self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/25823","fields":{"summary":"Pop-over for searching","status":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

The Twilio account defaults to a demo URL at Twilio, which is generating the messages we're seeing. I tried changing the URL to blank, but apparently Twilio becomes the default handler in the absence of a configured handler: the response changed, but it still says \"Reply STOP to unsubscribe. Msg&Data rates may apply.\"\r\n\r\nI set up a web service via Amazon Web Services to implement a hander URL. Unfortunately, this does not block Twilio from implementation of a minimal set of commands, including, as far as I have been able to determine, HELP and STOP. STOP does what one would expect; it blocks the sender from receiving SMS messages from our app; if we attempt to send one, we get an error response from Twilio and display an alert on the iPad indicating that the message could not be sent, and an error is logged: \"Error sending SMS 'Leanne Knoll, MD come to ggg stat.\\nSent by: Demo Arnette' to +16176103898: Unexpected status (400) returned by Twilio; The message From/To pair violates a blacklist rule.\" It does offer START as a means to resume receiving messages.\r\n\r\nI can change the message content to add \"Your colleague sent the message from the Shareable Ink application.

Now they are available and easy to use.\r\n\r\nRecommend creating a \"cancelReasons\" global lexicon (we need to create it separately in test, staging, and prod ultimately).

The list was wired into the code; the app now checks the customer configuration for a lexicon for the list, and reverts to the old wired-in list if none is available from the configuration.\r\n\r\nTo view or create the lexicon, log into the dashboard as dppadmin. On the dashboard, click on \"Users\"; on the user configuration page, click on \"Lexicon Management\" under the \"ShareableInk\" bar.\r\n\r\nLexicons can be customer specific, or generic to all customers (designated by the user code \"gen\", I think). The lexicon name for this feature is \"cancelReasons\".\r\n\r\nMy understanding of the lexicon management is as follows. If an iPad request the \"cancelReason\" lexicon, it will receive the one defined for the logged in user's customer code; if one doesn't exist, it will receive the one defined for \"gen\". If neither exists, the iPad will use the old wired-in list (and log an error message).\r\n\r\nI defined \"cancelReasons\" on test for \"brdbrsc33432\" and \"gen\".  The \"gen\" lexicon is identical to the old default. The \"brdbrsc33432\" lexicon adds on additional reason, \"Case Cancelled Due to Local Anesthesia\", as defined for this story.\r\n\r\nFully testing this story should probably involve editing lexicons on test and confirming that they are loaded by the iPad. (I'm not sure how frequently the iPad checks for changes; it might be as much as an hour. Clearing data on the iPad should guarantee that it loads an updated lexicon.)\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dknowles","name":"dknowles","emailAddress":"dknowles@shareableink.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dknowles&avatarId=10605","24x24":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dknowles&avatarId=10605","32x32":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dknowles&avatarId=10605","48x48":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dknowles&avatarId=10605"},"displayName":"Doug Knowles","active":true},"created":"2014-07-31T16:37:28.190-0500","updated":"2014-07-31T16:37:28.190-0500"},{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/26968/comment/27894","id":"27894","author":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=nwadhwa","name":"nwadhwa","emailAddress":"nwadhwa@shareableink.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=nwadhwa&avatarId=12503","24x24":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=nwadhwa&avatarId=12503","32x32":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=nwadhwa&avatarId=12503","48x48":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?ownerId=nwadhwa&avatarId=12503"},"displayName":"Neha Wadhwa","active":true},"body":"Working fine in the latest build.

Perhaps triple clicking -- or 2 finger clicking -- something needs to be decided, but here is the story\r\n\r\nOn the vital signs grid, by double clicking on the top most value on the top of the page, all of the previous time interval 'continuously variable' parameters (including O2, N2O, air, sevoflurane, desflurane, propofol infusions, EKG, SaO2, mode, RR, EtCO2, pawp, etc) should be copied.\r\n\r\nDr Plosker (resolute) says docs may struggle with multiple tapping to enable a feature.  Thinks a tap&hold activity that brings up a new choice like Copy Previous etc would be easier to use.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCurrently implemented:\r\n\r\n* Tap-hold-release on top section (grid) in demo mode offers duplication options for current row or \"all\" - it's not really all, but rows that are configured to allow duplication. (Need to discuss, see below.)\r\n* Duplicate this row behaves the same way as a double tap in that row.\r\n* If \"all\" is selected, all configured rows for that particular time will have their earlier values duplicated - unless there is a later value than the current time entered, in which case nothing will be duplicated for that row. (Need to discuss, see below.)\r\n\r\nTo discuss:\r\n\r\n* Need better wording for \"Duplicate All\" since it's not technically all.\r\n* What should rally happen with the duplicate all behavior when the duplicate option is selected at a time where some values exist after that time?\r\n* Currently, no explicit time selection is allowed - the time on which data lands corresponds to the time the user tapped, and cannot be adjusted. Should it be adjustable?\r\n* These changes do not include a duplication flag on the data as mentioned by Warren. Should we add that as another ticket?\r\n\r\n\r\n--- \r\n*Meeting Notes from Craig and Anne:*\r\nQ: Need better wording for \"Duplicate All\" since it's not technically all.\r\nA: For now, keep Duplicate All – we can’t come up with something better (descriptive, accurate and terse)\r\nQ: What should really happen with the duplicate all behavior when the duplicate option is selected at a time where some values exist after that time?\r\nA: Duplicate all prior values, even ones where there are values for later in the same row.\r\nQ: Currently, no explicit time selection is allowed - the time on which data lands corresponds to the time the user tapped, and cannot be adjusted. Should it be adjustable?\r\nA: Don’t add time selection. Do add a display of the time when it will be added. User can cancel.\r\n\r\nQ: These changes do not include a duplication flag on the data as mentioned by Warren. Should we add that as another ticket?\r\nA: Added FFBM-731 to Mimeo backlog for configuring deployments to have duplicable items.\r\nA: Do build functionality to add a flag in the log for values that were duplicated as a nice to have. Do not include in the release if it puts the release date at risk.","priority":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/priority/3","iconUrl":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/images/icons/priorities/major.png","name":"Major","id":"3"},"customfield_10001":"2014-02-12

respond until it's sure a second tap is not coming.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if you add triple tapping, a double-tap has to wait to trigger the UI until it's too late for the third tap.\r\n\r\nI realized last April that proper use of multi-tapping means that whether or not a second tap comes, the first tap should be able to do what it does right away. Similarly for double to triple; they should always be extensions of the same function (think of select, then open, or set cursor location, select word, select line).

EncounterViewController and EncounterListViewController. The EncounterViewController owns the list view and is responsible for the toolbar, setting up the layout and some other minor house keeping. This class will pretty much be kept the same. We just need to use the new ContextToolBar framework instead of old toolbar.\r\n\r\nThe EncounterListViewController is a UITableViewController that deals with the layout of the list, sorting etc. This class needs to be changed a lot. SITableView will be used instead of a UITableView so the EncounterListViewController will not be a UITableViewController anymore. It will be a normal UIViewController that conforms tp the SITableView's protocols. See CaseMacroListViewController for an example of how to use the SITableView. \r\n\r\nThe SITableView will handle selection, column layout, animation etc. What it doesn't support currently is having different row types per object type. A bulk of the work in this ticket revolves around extracting that out of EncounterListViewController and come up with a generic framework that will be part of SITableView for handling different row types per object type. \r\n\r\nAny type of logic that is dependent on the type of object..e.g. different heights for different object row will need to be solved as well. We need to solve it in a generic manner since the SITableView is a highly reusable class that shouldn't have any SI dependencies. \r\n\r\nA column in the EncounterListViewController can be clicked on and an action triggered e.g. Favorites, tapping on alerts. This is handled by the SITableView because it supports custom columns where you can hook up custom functionality.\r\n\r\nA question remains: Are we going to port over PatientStatus to this new UI framework? Is PatientStatus being promised to customers? If it is, then we would need to support it. The SITableView supports configurable columns but there might still be work involved in setting this thing up. \r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=pmoberg","name":"pmoberg","emailAddress":"pmoberg@shareableink.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10122","24x24":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10122","32x32":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10122","48x48":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10122"},"displayName":"Peter Moberg","active":true},"created":"2014-07-18T15:34:30.192-0500","updated":"2014-07-18T15:34:30.192-0500"},{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/25579/comment/27286","id":"27286","author":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dknowles","name":"dknowles","emailAddress":"dknowles@shareableink.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dknowles&avatarId=10605","24x24":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dknowles&avatarId=10605","32x32":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dknowles&avatarId=10605","48x48":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dknowles&avatarId=10605"},"displayName":"Doug Knowles","active":true},"body":"Just a small elaboration on the PatientStatus/Whiteboard support: The original implementation was rushed for demo purposes and is functional, but devilishly difficult to configure. Since configuration expense has become an apparent problem with iPad features, there seems to be a feeling that we won't be deploying configurable PatientStatus any time soon. We should decide now, all along the food chain from Sales to Professional Services, whether configurable PatientStatus is off the table for now. Whenever we do decide to commit to it as a supported feature, we need to decide that configuration support is an integral part of the cost of implementing and deploying this, or any other, feature.

It's actually on a field by field basis, not page by page, but you get the idea.\r\n\r\nSo if you throw away one of the pages you could be losing half of the entries made. Although when one form has 100% different fields filled in than the other, merging is easy and rarely fails. The problems come in when BOTH forms have something different for the SAME field. Like daily smoker on one, and non-smoker on the other.\r\n\r\nNow what I saw when looking at two of the cases was different in that one page was blank of entries, except for a signature, and it was a slightly different signature and was more recent (occurred later). If they threw away the one with only a signature, they would be left with a form with an inaccurate signature time. In fact in that case it is pretty obvilus that the merge issue was because the CRNA went back an hour and a half later and re-signed the form; no idea why, but she did. And while the iPad server software *should* have discarded the original signature and time and replaced it with the new one; it didn't.\r\n\r\nBut if they examine the two forms and are OK with discarding, and losing the data on one of them, I guess that's up to them.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=PScott","name":"PScott","emailAddress":"pscott@shareableink.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=pscott&avatarId=12303","24x24":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=pscott&avatarId=12303","32x32":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=pscott&avatarId=12303","48x48":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?ownerId=pscott&avatarId=12303"},"displayName":"Pete Scott","active":true},"created":"2014-07-30T12:59:53.255-0500","updated":"2014-07-30T12:59:53.255-0500"},{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/26969/comment/27831","id":"27831","author":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=PScott","name":"PScott","emailAddress":"pscott@shareableink.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=pscott&avatarId=12303","24x24":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=pscott&avatarId=12303","32x32":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=pscott&avatarId=12303","48x48":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?ownerId=pscott&avatarId=12303"},"displayName":"Pete Scott","active":true},"body":"As another FYI, just saw an email from a Jerry Szelagowski, MD at bkaios45804\r\n\r\nThey too are seeing duplicates in the Review tab.\r\n\r\nPete","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=PScott","name":"PScott","emailAddress":"pscott@shareableink.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=pscott&avatarId=12303","24x24":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=pscott&avatarId=12303","32x32":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=pscott&avatarId=12303","48x48":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?ownerId=pscott&avatarId=12303"},"displayName":"Pete Scott","active":true},"created":"2014-07-31T12:19:52.878-0500","updated":"2014-07-31T12:19:52.878-0500"},{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/26969/comment/27832","id":"27832","author":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=Paul+Beard","name":"Paul Beard","emailAddress":"pbeard@shareableink.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10122","24x24":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10122","32x32":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10122","48x48":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10122"},"displayName":"Paul Beard","active":true},"body":"i don't think that's the case, they aren't ipad they are dpp.  i think they are referring to the last name appearing twice due to differing form HWR settings.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=Paul+Beard","name":"Paul Beard","emailAddress":"pbeard@shareableink.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10122","24x24":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10122","32x32":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10122","48x48":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10122"},"displayName":"Paul Beard","active":true},"created":"2014-07-31T12:21:33.806-0500","updated":"2014-07-31T12:24:47.530-0500"},{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/26969/comment/27858","id":"27858","author":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=craig+fields","name":"craig fields","emailAddress":"cfields@shareableink.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10122","24x24":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10122","32x32":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10122","48x48":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10122"},"displayName":"Craig Fields","active":true},"body":"So far, it turns out this doesn't have anything to do with merging. We've looked at two cases so far.\r\n\r\n*301424*\r\n\r\nThis is an older case, and is an instance of a long standing server bug which was fixed in the last few weeks. Remember the situation where if your purge time was two weeks, then two week old encounters would briefly reappear for no apparent reason? If you then tapped on one of those two week old encounters, it would reopen a case and create new forms for it. Those forms are generally useless and can be removed. Unless a confused user decided to enter real data on them. Keep in mind that some forms may be populated automatically by some autofill data, and so while they look like a user filled some of them out, really they didn't.\r\n\r\n*301129 - 2*\r\n\r\nThis took a while to track down, and is a newly discovered (but old) bug. It goes like this:\r\n\r\n1. Customer has autofill configured in their system.\r\n2. Customer completes a case. (In this instance, Dr. Plosker completed 10 cases in 3 minutes. This will increase substantially the probability of seeing this problem.)\r\n3. If things happen just right, a minute or so after completing the case, the encounter associated with the completed case may reappear - for one minute.\r\n4. If during that one minute, the user notices the encounter and taps on it, this results in reopening the case and creating new empty forms (plus autofill) for the case.\r\n5. If the user does not tap the case within that one minute window, the encounter will disappear, never to be seen again.\r\n\r\nAs above, these forms are useless and may be removed unless a user has for some reason entered important data on them.\r\n\r\n*Notes*\r\n\r\n* The correct fix for this involved an iPad software update. I suspect there is not a way around it, but I'm still thinking about it.\r\n* I still need to investigate a few more cases to make sure they all have one of the two causes above.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=craig+fields","name":"craig fields","emailAddress":"cfields@shareableink.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10122","24x24":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10122","32x32":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10122","48x48":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10122"},"displayName":"Craig Fields","active":true},"created":"2014-08-01T00:26:43.112-0500","updated":"2014-08-01T00:26:43.112-0500"},{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/26969/comment/28027","id":"28027","author":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=craig+fields","name":"craig fields","emailAddress":"cfields@shareableink.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10122","24x24":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10122","32x32":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10122","48x48":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10122"},"displayName":"Craig Fields","active":true},"body":"branch_2_6 build 456","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=craig+fields","name":"craig fields","emailAddress":"cfields@shareableink.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10122","24x24":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10122","32x32":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10122","48x48":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10122"},"displayName":"Craig Fields","active":true},"created":"2014-08-04T13:28:55.770-0500","updated":"2014-08-04T13:28:55.770-0500"},{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/26969/comment/28030","id":"28030","author":{"self":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=nwadhwa","name":"nwadhwa","emailAddress":"nwadhwa@shareableink.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=nwadhwa&avatarId=12503","24x24":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=nwadhwa&avatarId=12503","32x32":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=nwadhwa&avatarId=12503","48x48":"https://shareableink.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?ownerId=nwadhwa&avatarId=12503"},"displayName":"Neha Wadhwa","active":true},"body":"Completed Cases Still reappear in the latest build.
