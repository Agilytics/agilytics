For example we may change the data type of something to a new type that is unknown to older versions of the iPad.\r\n\r\nWe need to prevent the older software from being able to see it.\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to do this is:\r\n\r\n* Have the iPad send up its version number with each request.\r\n* Tag each Couch form definition and clinical data definition document with a minimum compatible version number.\r\n* When the server sends changes down to the iPad, have it not send changes unless they are compatible.\r\n\r\nWe could keep multiple document versions on the server, and serve the highest compatible version to the iPad, but I don't see any reason we need anything that complex. In general, the iPads should take new releases immediately, but since we can't guarantee that, it's enough to just make sure they work as well as before - if the user can log in and use it, it must work correctly.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to reload an iPad with on old version with fresh data, it will simply not install (it will keep waiting to get forms from the server that will never come). And this is fine - since the user will not be able to use it correctly.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nImplementation details:\r\n\r\n* For ClinicalDataDefinitions, the storage format has changed slightly. Previously the Couch document contained a dataDefinitions element which was a JSON array of clinical data definitions. Now it is an object with two elements: \"clinicalVersion\", a number representing the clinical data version compatibility number, and \"definitions\", which contains the JSON array of definitions.\r\n* For FormDefinitions, there is just a \"clinicalVersion\" number added to the meta attachment JSON.\r\n* For all data calls, the iPad sends up its clinicalVersion.\r\n* If the iPad's clinicalVersion number is greater than or equal to the clinicalVersion number for a given form or set of data definitions (and the data is not already on the iPad), the data is sent down. Otherwise, it is not sent down, and the iPad will keep what it already has.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n* Whenever a non-backwards compatible enhancement is made to a form that requires new iPad support, the clinicalVersion number on the iPad must be bumped, and the affected form's clinicalVersion number must be set to match. Similarly for the clinical data definitions.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n\r\nIn general, we should be able to upgrade iPads and forms largely independently without breaking old installed iPads. We will consider it acceptable to not allow iPads at old versions to be installed. This issue should specifically allow those kinds of changes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we should be always be able to upgrade a server without having to upgrade an iPad (at least immediately - we need to support at least one version back for the iPad), and upgrade an iPad without having to upgrade a server. This applies to all changes made on either side, but is more relevant for certain kinds of server changes, including this one.\r\n\r\nTo test the cases that will actually apply when upgrading Broad to the next release:\r\n\r\n* Prepare two iPads, have one upgraded (153) and one not (147). (147 available as snapshot build on web page, don't have to go through Confluence + iTunes)\r\n* Verify the upgraded iPad works with the old server build. (pre-serenada-master build 337)\r\n* Upgrade the server to serenada-master 337 or later.\r\n* Verify the non-upgraded iPad works with the upgraded server. (IPAD-436, IPAD-437, IPAD-497, IPAD-500 should work the old way)\r\n* Upgrade the PreOp form (ask Craig).\r\n* Verify continued functioning of old iPad with specified fields.\r\n* Verify enhanced functioning of new iPad with specified fields.\r\n","status":null,"assigneeId":2,"reporterId":2,"storyType":"story","sprintStoryIds":["IPAD-491"],"subtaskIds":[]},"IPAD-492":{"id":274,"pid":"IPAD-492","acuity":"Major","create_date":"2013-05-28T05:00:00Z","done":true,"doneDate":null,"location":null,"size":null,"name":"two anesthesia record forms available in demo","description":"*URL:* https://test-dashboard.shareableink.net\r\n*Account:* demo / demo\r\n*dashboard build: NA\r\n*ipad build:* version 148\r\n\r\n*steps to reproduce*\r\n1 - open an existing demo\r\n\r\nnote: in the patient profile there are two anesthesia records. one is currently selected\r\n\r\n2 - add the currently not selected anesthesia record (top of form list for me)\r\n\r\n3 - select the new ames rec tab (first on left)\r\n\r\nnote: SI app crashes at this point\r\nnote: see file attachment for crash log","status":null,"assigneeId":2,"reporterId":25,"storyType":"story","sprintStoryIds":["IPAD-492"],"subtaskIds":[]},"IPAD-493":{"id":275,"pid":"IPAD-493","acuity":"Major","create_date":"2013-05-28T05:00:00Z","done":true,"doneDate":null,"location":null,"size":null,"name":"inconsistency in date of service display on form between demo and not demo","description":"*URL:* https://test-dashboard.shareableink.net\r\n*Account:* demo / demo\r\n*dashboard build: NA\r\n*ipad build:* version 148\r\n\r\n*steps to reproduce*\r\n1 - open an existing encounter\r\n\r\n2 - select a form\r\n\r\nnote: the date of service field at the bottom of the form is populated as a date time stamp.

Previously we just had F4, and now F1-F3 have been made available by moving Done and Cancel into the toolbar.\r\n* We should try to turn the delete button (formerly \"DEL\") into the appropriate icon if we can find one.\r\n\r\nThe button sketches are proposed layouts for the function keys for issues IPAD-409, IPAD-437, IPAD-436, IPAD-402, and IPAD-444. We outline all of the use cases here so we have a central reference for requirements when defining the architecture.\r\n\r\nGeneral functionality:\r\n\r\n* Cancel and Done continue to work as they do now.\r\n* Tapping outside of the popup generally means Done. If the keypad is in a state where no data has been entered, it should be taken to mean cancel.\r\n* \"Clear Value\" is a normal prettified button, the width of (or most of the width of) the popup. Pressing it should terminate the popup, and return the empty string as the final value to the caller.\r\n** Any chance this will be hit accidentally? Does it matter?\r\n* The delete button will generally apply only to values that are entered from the non-function keys of the keypad. For date/time entry, it will only delete time characters. For FiO2 or ETCO2 it will only affect the numeric values, not the + or NC toggles.\r\n\r\nFunction keys:\r\n\r\n* F4 should generally be used for delimiters tied to the numbers being entered (\".\" for decimals, \":\" for times, \"/\" for dates).\r\n* Outside of that, I think additional functionality should be added top to button - F1, F2, F3.\r\n* I imagine that we won't instantiate unused function keys - no button will be drawn in those cases.\r\n\r\nInput types to be supported:\r\n\r\n* BP - functions as now\r\n* Integer - functions as now\r\n* Decimal - functions as now\r\n* Time - needs to display during editing as in drawing (Day MM/DD), but store as full ISO timestamp the way we store times on forms in general. F1=\"D+\", F2=\"D-\" to increment and decrement day if needed. F4=\":\". Delete button only affects time entry, nothing related to date.\r\n* Date - Should display as MM/DD/YYYY, but store as ISO timestamp, local midnight. Might as well have D+/D- buttons here has well - that way we can default to today for some date fields and they can be tweaked without hitting delete back through the year. But we don't want the default for DOB. They should probably be disabled if a full date is not entered, since we wouldn't know what to increment/decrement.\r\n* FiO2 - F1=\"\\+\", toggles presence of \"\\+\" in display. Want button to show in highlighted state when enabled. Display as \"123\", \"123+\", or \"\\+\". Store as \"123|\", \"123|\\+\", \"|\\+\". Implications to both printing and rendering.\r\n* ETCO2 - F1=\"NC\"... Generally same as FiO2. Display as \"123\", \"123 NC\", or \"NC\". Store as \"123|\", \"123|NC\", \"|NC\". Implications to both printing and rendering.\r\n* Height - no function keys. Displays as \"4ft 7in\", stores as \"55\". First digit entered is always feet. Optional second and third digits are inches.
